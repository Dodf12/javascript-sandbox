//Arithmetic Operators

let x;

x = 5 + 5;
x = 5-5;
x=5*5;
x = 5 / 5;
x = 5 % 5;

//Concatenation
x = 'Hello' + 'Wolrd';

//Exponent
x=2**3;

//Increment
x=1;
x = x + 1;
x++;

//Decrement has basically same thing that applies

//Assignment Operators
x = 10;
x += 5;

//Comparison

x = 2 == 2;
x = 2 === 2; //Triple equal evaluates value and the type

x = 2 != 2;
x = 2!== 2;

x = 10 > 5;
x = 10 < 5;
